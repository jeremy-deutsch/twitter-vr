# twitter-vr

A small experiment in building swipe-based UIs with VR hand tracking.

Built with [react-xr](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-xr) and [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), on top of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).

## To run

WebVR requires HTTPS, so after running `yarn`:

### Mac/Linux

```
HTTPS=true yarn start
```

### Powershell

```
($env:HTTPS = "true") -and (yarn start)
```
